# This workflow checks that the PR has been approved by 2+ members of the committee listed in `pull_requests.toml`.
#
# Run this action when a pull request review is submitted / dismissed.
# Note that an approval can be dismissed, and this can affect the job status.
# We currently trust that contributors won't make significant changes to their PRs after approval, so we accept
# changes after approval.
#
# We still need to run this in the case of a merge group, since it is a required step. In that case, the workflow
# is a NOP.
